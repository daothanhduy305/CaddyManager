# Git Configuration and Preferences

## Git Configuration
- The user prefers that the assistant not add launch.json by default; they will add it only when needed

## Commit and Security
- Check the launch.json file for secrets before committing. If secrets are found, replace them with 'SECRET', commit the changes, and restore the original secret values afterwards
