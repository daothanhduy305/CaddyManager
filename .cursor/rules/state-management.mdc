# State Management and Caching Strategies

## Caching Strategies
- Implement in-memory caching for frequently used data, especially for Blazor Server apps. Use IMemoryCache for lightweight caching solutions
- For Blazor, utilize EboloState (create the inheritance states where necessary) to cache application state between user sessions
- Consider Distributed Cache strategies (like Redis or SQL Server Cache) for larger applications that need shared state across multiple users or clients
- Cache API calls by storing responses to avoid redundant calls when data is unlikely to change, thus improving the user experience

## State Management Libraries
- For server-side Blazor, use Scoped Services and the StateContainer pattern to manage state within user sessions while minimizing re-renders
